# Introduction:
Everyday millions of people around the world uses commercial airliner travelling between one place to another, as a result, thousands of aircrafts are getting takeoff and land every minutes. To ensure smooth operation of all those aircrafts flying between one city to other we need to have most reliable schedule of takeoff timing and landing timing. Take off timing is obvious, but choosing landing timing for schedule is very critical, because we need to consider all the possible scenarios like, Early / Late departure, Taxi Timing at each airport, and In-air Timing (the time in-between Take-off and Landing), that is where Monte Carlo Simulation is very helpful.
